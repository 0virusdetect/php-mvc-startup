## **I have created a PHP Startup File using MVC Sturcture**
I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple PHP MVC Structured files that you can copy/paste and use in your Project.

## **For Linux users**
**Go to Directory -** /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

    <Directory /var/www/html>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
    </Directory>

**Add the above code in that File**

**Then,Restart your apache Server** 

    sudo systemctl restart apache2

## **Create a .htaccess file**
**Go to Directory -** /var/www/html/.htaccess

**then, add these lines**

    RewriteEngine on

## **Databse setup**

* Then copy and paste the mvc.sql File Data into sql Query 
* Then change the Username and Password in config/database.php file
